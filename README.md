Remote JMX Health Check

## Installation
You will need the jmxhealth-server to collect the health state of all applications you want to monitor.
The server exports the informations via a RESTful API.

See the [jmxhealth-server Documentation](./jmxhealth-server/README.md) for more details.


In addition you will need a tool that checks the collected informations periodically and informs you about problems.
Therefore jmxhealth offers a system tray application.
See the [jmxhealth-tray Documentation](./jmxhealth-tray/README.md) for more details.
